/**
 * STRIPE_OVERFLOW_WORKAROUND (default on)
 *
 * This option activates a workaround for an apparent bug in the
 * firmware of the printers (printing a dithered photo with a wideness
 * larger than 80% of the paper size can crash the printer). There are
 * no particular disadvantages in having this enabled. Epson drivers for
 * Windows/Mac have no such option (yes, they may crash the printer).

/**
 * USE_DELTA_STRATEGY (default off)
 *
 * This option activates additional code which produces smaller spool
 * files but uses more CPU time (on the host). You can try it if
 * you have a relatively fast (>50MHz) machine. When this option
 * is enabled, spool files are very similar to those generated by
 * Epson drivers for Windows/Mac; the default is off (bigger files).

#undef USE_DELTA_STRATEGY


/**
 * COARSE_HORIZONTAL_POSITION (default on)
 *
 * This option is only meaningful if the TopLeft IJS command is used
 * to place the bitmap at generic coordinates on paper (different from
 * PrintableTopLeft), but there is no known client using this feature
 * at the moment (ghostscript doesn't). Enabling this can cause a
 * very small misplacement of the bitmap in the horizontal
 * direction (4 pixel max, which is less than 0.34mm at 300 dpi and
 * less than 0.09mm at 1200 dpi), but reduces the CPU load."
 * (NOTE: code to support generic coordinates has not been integrated
 * yet)
